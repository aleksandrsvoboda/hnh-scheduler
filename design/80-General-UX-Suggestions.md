## General UX Suggestions

1. Improve hierarchy with visuals

- More use of cards, panels, and spacing to group related options.
- Primary actions (Save, Add, Test) should be visually stronger than destructive ones (Delete).

2. Help & tooltips
- Since this app has domain-specific terms (concurrency, overlap, scenario steps), hover-tooltips or a small “?” info icon would reduce confusion.

3. Color & typography
- Status and state (enabled/disabled, success/failure, queued) should lean more on color cues and badges.
- Example: green “Enabled”, gray “Disabled”, red “Error”.
